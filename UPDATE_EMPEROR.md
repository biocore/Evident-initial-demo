Update Evident to the latest version of Emperor
===============================================

Make sure to add Emperor into your [configuration](https://github.com/qiime/evident/blob/master/INSTALL.md#configuration).

Copy all support files from Emperor to Evident:
`cp -r emperor_path/emperor/support_files/ www/emperor_required_resources`

Yes, it is that easy!
